  "description": "<p>Patagonia is the land of the untamed. Left behind in time, inhabited mostly by rheas, guanacos and sheep inland and settled only by those who can find happiness in solitude and the vastness of its sights.</p></p><p>Frequently visited by whales and the Magel lan penguins by its coast, wilderness is ubiquitous. Gauchos, working ranches and fishing lodges coexist with jagged glaciers completing the picture.</p><p>Its dramatic wind ridden landscape and bare steppe would mesmerize you. And its playful wind would intrigue you.</p><p>A far away land that has captivated explorers and scientist alike w ould unquestionably stun you as well</p>"
