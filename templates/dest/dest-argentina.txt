  "description": "Often defined as the land of the gauchos and beef, a description that portraits a romantic countryside, Argentina is much more than that and as extensive as its territory.||The belle epoque palaces of Buenos Aires, the roaring clamor of the Iguassu Falls. The indigenous untouched heritage paired up with its Martian-like scenery in its Northwest, the untamed howling winds of Patagonia with all its rugged beauty. This is Argentina. ||The Southern-most city in the World, Ushuaia, witnessing immutable so many Antarctic voyages. Its dramatic cliff laden Atlantic coast, the wilderness and remoteness of its steppe. ||A country that has deserts, subtropical forests, falls, grasslands and jungles. A land that can grow almost any imaginable crop can also offer an incredible cultural scene. ||Epic barbecues are combined with top notch properties and a hospitality and friendliness that is second to none. If its tango is up close and personal, so are its people, that embrace you and make you feel not only like you are home, but like you should return soon."
