  "description": "Peru is one of the most visited countries in America for a good reason. Better said: there are many reasons.||It is an open invitation to see and experience ancient ruins and to connect with its history and traditions. ||The Inca civilization was sophisticated and intriguing and left behind incredible sites with precise architecture. ||Sacred Valley showcases a spectacular collection of ruins and a schooled terraced landscape fit for their agricultural needs. ||Machu Picchu is not only a wonder, is a fascinating visit. The people you get to meet would yield cultural connections to their heritage, ways and life different from yours.|| The culture is rich, alive and generous. The handicraft is vivid, joyful and full of character. ||The natural diversity is as varied as the countryâ€™s affluent geography: high flats, valleys Atlantic coast and Amazonian Forest.|| Its cuisine is indulging, fresh, inviting. ||Their culture: omnipresent. Peru is vast, enthusiastic, authentic. An invitation to explore and a gift to the eyes."
