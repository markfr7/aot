  "description": "For most, their 7th continent. For many, the epitome of their bucket list. For others, the trip they took to ride along their significant other. || In all cases, we, mortals, surrender in awe to its beauty, a place stunningly extreme.||Often described as Earthâ€™s last frontier, it actually feels closer to being out of this world, at least as we know it. Regardless of where you live, whether your familiar landscape is a city skyline, the wild outdoors, a town or a farmland, Antarctica scenery is surreal. ||It strikes your eyes, your heart and your very soul. ||From towering glaciers to adorable penguins, Antarctica is a wonderland of breathtaking sights and sounds. It's like stepping into a whole new world, where the air is crisp, the water is immaculate, and the scenery is absolutely epic. ||So pristine, so untouched, so magical and silent it is the perfect place to travel deep within yourself. A place of exploration, of the elements and the outdoors, a place of incredible wildlife also becomes a place of introspection. ||Nobody comes back being the same, just because while there it becomes obvious how big the picture is. That is what is so mystic about it. You travel afar to reach within.
