  "description": "No documentary will ever do any justice to the Galapagos Islands.||Although majestic and impressive, nothing comes even close to navigating its waters and walking their shores. For one simple reason: being followed by curious seals who want to approach you is simply indescribable. And being surrounded by interested and curious blue footed boobies, unreal.||Willing to interact with you, ready to explore you as much as you are to explore them.||Nothing is fake, nothing is pretended. It is raw, naïve nature at its best.||If it would be a book, each one of its islands will write a different chapter. Volcanic, with dramatic character, rugged shores or pinnacle rocks, one of the most distinctive features of them is that they all have their own personality and impromptu and are very different from each other. Ready to be discovered, to show you their charisma, ready to play and interact with you, just like its nature."
