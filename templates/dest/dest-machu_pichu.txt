  "description": "One of the 7 Wonders of the world, a place visited by almost 2 million people yearly, yet it has that intriguing power of making you feel like it is talking personally to you. ||Coveted between grassy hills, sometimes even behind a cloudy veil, its beauty speaks by itself. A breathtaking layout atop a spectacular viewpoint will help you marvel at the mysteries of the Inca civilization. || Itâ€™s a must see to believe: the architecture includes more than 150 buildings ranging from baths and houses to temples and sanctuaries, with stonework so precise that not even a paper would fit in between."
