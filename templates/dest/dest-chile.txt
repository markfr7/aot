  "description": "Being the longest in the world, if you open a map of the country, you will be unfolding –multiple times over- a surprising geography. ||Likewise, when you visit, your eyes will unveil to dramatic landscapes: from the driest desert in the world up North –Atacama- to the jagged fjords in the South. ||Stretching only a little over 100 miles wide, Chile boasts one of the most stunning National Parks, Torres del Paine and its impressive granite massif and towers. It has glaciers, the largest continental ice field and, impressively, fertile valleys pinched between mountainous ranges that grow some outstanding wine and fruits alike.||The Lakes District is as painteresque with its temperamental volcanoes as the city of Valparaiso is captivating with its rolling hills, bohemian flair and graffiti art. ||Straightforward, yet rich in every way, Chile has made of itself a welcoming destination for the adventure seekers, the modern travelers and families alike."
